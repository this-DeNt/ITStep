            <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup style="color: blue;"><b>[1]</b></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. 
            Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), 
            amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup style="color: blue;"><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
            
            <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. 
            ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup style="color: blue;";"><b>[3]</b></sup></p>
